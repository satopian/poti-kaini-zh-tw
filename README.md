### Overview of required work.
There is a language resource for messages in `template_ini.php`, such as error messages and messages used when images are uploaded successfully.  
The HTML of the template uses Japanese, so we need to translate it.  
We also need to translate the external search programs `search.php` and `search.html`.    
However, potiboard.php externalizes all language settings, so no changes are needed.  
Translation of `config.php`. We need to translate the description of the settings.

To
Change to   
`define('CHECK_CSRF_TOKEN', '0');`.
If you enable this setting when the theme is not supported, you will not be able to post.
If this setting is not present in `config.php`  
`define('CHECK_CSRF_TOKEN', '0');`  
Is treated the same as.
- Moved to the method of checking HTML at the time of output.  
Administrators can no longer use HTML tags.  
HTML tags that have already been entered will be deleted.  
The output is the HTML tags removed and escaped.  
- The form on the top page and the mini-less form displayed in each thread have been abolished.  
This is because you cannot set the CSRF token in a static HTML file.  
- ChickenPaint is now available on your smartphone.
